Strings Revisited
-----------------

You have just passed a very important point in your study of Python programming.  Even though there is much more that we will do, you have learned all of the basic building blocks that are necessary to solve many interesting problems.  From an algorithm point of view, you can now implement selection and iteration.  You can also solve problems by breaking them down into smaller parts, writing functions for those parts, and then calling the functions to complete the implementation.
What remains is to focus on ways that we can better represent our problems in terms of the data that we manipulate.  We will now turn our attention to studying the main data collections provided by Python.

Throughout the first chapters of this book we have used strings to represent words or phrases that we
wanted to print out.  Our definition was simple:  a string is simply some characters inside quotes.  In this chapter we explore strings in much more detail.
