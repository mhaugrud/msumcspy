Introduction
------------

We have seen in the previous chapter how modules like math, random, and turtle contain many useful functions. Functions provide several important advantages to computer scientists.

.. admonition:: Think about it

   You used various math and random module functions. Do you know **how** they work? No? We don't need to worry about that. It is not important. You only need to know **what** they do and how to call them. This frees us to concentrate on the problem we do need to need to work on. This advantage is called **abstraction**.

   Functions give us a way to break large problems into small pieces. It is easier to solve small problems than large ones. A well designed function is an independent solution to a small problem. We may even be able to reuse these small solutions for other larger problems! This advantage is called **modularization**.
