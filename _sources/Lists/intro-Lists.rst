Lists
=====

A **list** is a sequential collection of data values, where each value is associated with an
**index**. The values that make up a list are called its **elements**.

Lists are similar to strings, in that they are both ordered collections. A key difference between 
lists and strings is that strings only contain characters. The elements of a list can be of any 
data type and for any given list, its elements can be of different types. 

Since a list contains other things, we call it a **container class**. In the future we will explore
other container classes.
